## Code to color text
Now since May 2022, Github can accept LATEX code on Markdown, so you can use the \color{namecolor} inside the $$$$ Block, like the example below:
$${\color{red}Red \space\space \color{green}Green \space\space \color{lightgreen}Light \space Green \space\space \color{blue}Blue \space\space \color{lightblue}Light \space Blue \color{white}White \space\space \color{black}Black \space\space}$$
$${\color{red}Red}$$
$${\color{green}Green}$$
$${\color{lightgreen}Light \space Green}$$
$${\color{blue}Blue}$$
$${\color{lightblue}Light \space Blue}$$
$${\color{black}Black}$$
$${\color{white}White}$$
